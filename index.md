[MY LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linda-vuong-3664821ba/) 

Welcome to my (Linda Vuong's) GitHub website! 

This website consists of my work as a student. I'm glad you chose to stay and take your time cruising through the website! Times have been rough lately with new strains of COVID-19 and the recent cases of Monkeypox. I hope you're all healthy and doing well!

This is a cover photo I designed for my LinkedIn header. It's extremely personalized as each symbol plays a role in who I am.

I value collaboration as well as networking. 

Being a woman in STEM, I aim to work and perform as well as my male counterparts to the point where noone will underestimate me due to my gender.

I am creative and my cognitive gears are always on as I bring bright and new ideas to the table.

I am very interested in the world of Tech and take great pleasure in learning about technology when I can.
